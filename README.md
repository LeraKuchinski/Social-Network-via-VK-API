# Social-Network-via-VK-API


The project has the following structure:
# Descriptive statistics

1. Node attributes;
2. Number of nodes and edges;
3. Diameter, radius;
4. Clustering coefficient (global, average local, histogram);
5. Average path length (histogram);
6. Degree distribution, fitted models by regression/KS-test;
7. Gorgeous network layout. 

# Structural Analysis
1. Random graph generation;
2. Comparison with Barabasi-Albert and Small World models;
3. Degree/Closeness/Betweenness/Katz/Eigenvector centralities;
4. Top nodes description;
5. Correlation comparison of centralities;
6. Assortative mixing by node attributes and node degree;
7. Node structural equivalence/similarity.


# Community Detection

1. Clique search, k-cores visualization;
2. Clustering on graph (specteal clustering, agglomirative clustering, label propogation).
